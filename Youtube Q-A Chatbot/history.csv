Dating all the way back to the Paleolithic Age, India's civilization is one of the oldest that we know and has played a part on the world stage for centuries and even still today. While it is impossible to truly capture all of India's history in one video, it still serves as a worthy topic to delve into. Evidence of cave paintings and stone tools have revealed that the first signs of human activity in India can be traced back to somewhere between 400,000 and 200,000 BC. Details concerning the civilizations inhabiting the region back that long ago do not exist, but we do know that one of the first sophisticated societies to walk the lands of India was the Harappan people, who likely existed throughout the first few thousand years BC. Positioned along the Indus River, the Harappan people had their own writing system, advanced social and economic system, and impressive urban cities and architecture. It is unknown why this civilization collapsed around 1500 BC, but some attribute their demise to the common floods and other natural disasters in the region or potentially invaders from Western and Central Asia. The next known civilization to leave a mark on Indian history books was the Vedic Aryans. These people were initially migrants who spoke an early form of Sanskrit and were determined to stay true to their own tribal identity. The name they have been given, the Vedic people, comes from four sacred texts, or Vedas, that have presented researchers with a glimpse into the civilization's lives and beliefs. These Vedas are often considered to be the oldest Hindu scripts, and the Vedic civilization is believed to have spread their culture across a large portion of India by roughly 1000 BC. With them, the Vedic Aryans brought their philosophical beliefs. These ideas represent a theory that happiness and salvation come from a person's morals and ethics, and one's path should be based upon their place in life, but should always be righteous and good. The Vedic Aryans also shared their societal system as they extended their reach. This system was made up originally of three tiers, Brahmin or priest, Kshatriya or warrior, and Vaishya or commoner. The Aryans continued to spread their tribal settlements across India throughout the following centuries as their own civilization grew and flourished in both culture and trade. A series of 16 individual settlements or states spanned across northern India, including the Gandhara, Kosala, Kuru and the Magadha. The latter particularly flourished under the rule of Chandragupta Maurya during the 4th century BC as it began to expand and its leader grew his own authority and worked to form the Mauryan Empire, which is believed to be the first Indian imperial power. The Mauryan Empire established its capital in Pataliputra near modern-day Patna and constructed extraordinary temples, libraries, palaces and even a university. The empire's trade success was impressive and it maintained a remarkable governmental system and strong army. By the time of the third emperor, the grandson of Chandragupta, a stance of nonviolence was taken after a bloody struggle against the kingdom of Kalinga due to the emperor's new Buddhist beliefs. Kingdom's head Harthagottama, the Buddha, had been born in 560 BC and by the reign of Emperor Ashoka, the religious system he had founded was becoming more and more prevalent throughout India. Potentially due to their unwillingness to participate in conflict though, the Mauryan Empire eventually dissolved in the 2nd century BC after the last line of the Maurya line, Brihadratha, was murdered by his commander-in-chief who would later found the Shunga dynasty in 185 BC. Despite the fact that Brihadratha's assassin Pushyamitra was rumored to have persecuted Buddhists, it appeared that Buddhism faced no decline concurrent with his rise to power. During Pushyamitra's reign, his kingdom maintained authority over a series of provinces as he stood his ground against other powers attempting to expand their territory towards his own. After the monarch's death though, his dynasty seemed to have fallen in terms of importance. The dynasty is not known to have done anything notably relevant and their control was short-lived. A variety of settlements and invading powers controlled India at this time, one being the Kushana Kingdom. Known for their significant trade involvement with Chinese, Persian and Roman empires along the Silk Road, one Kushana ruler, Kanishka in the 1st century AD also converted to Buddhism and helps to further the religion throughout the region. In 75 AD, the Kushana Kingdom marked a new era, the Shaka era. A bit of distance from the Kushanas in the south, a handful of other powers rose, fell and fought for supremacy amongst each other. The kingdoms of Satavahana, Chera, Chola and Panjya were some of the major authorities in the south during this time and through the classical age. The Gupta Empire became the face of northern India during the classical age and the majority of the region was united under their authority during what is often described as northern India's golden age. The reign of the Gupta Empire is regarded as a time of law and order as well as cultural flourishing. The rulers of the empire were no strangers to military expedition but aimed to expand their territory through peaceful means such as martial alliances no less than through military action. Though the Gupta Empire had extensive success over centuries, they eventually reached a point of decline between the 5th and 6th centuries as invading Huns from Central Asia began to annex and take over the formerly dominant empire's land. As the religions of Buddhism and what later became Hinduism thrived, local and trespassing authorities continued to fight for territory and dominion over the following centuries. The next major shake-up of the Indian civilization came with the arrival of Islam. Muslim invaders began to send missions to India the century after the death of the prophet Muhammad. A series of Muslim sultans began to lead expeditions into India, claiming places such as Sindh, Multan and Somnath. These incursions brought the defeat of native kingdoms and the destruction of Hindu temples along the way. The Rajputs stood as one of the most determined defenders against sultan invaders but they were ultimately defeated in 1192 by Muhammad Ghori and his forces. As Islam began to work its way into India, other previously principal religions such as Buddhism began to decline. By the start of the 13th century, the era of the Delhi Sultanate dominion arose. The first dynasty within the Delhi Sultanate was founded by Qutub-ud-Din Ayyub. The slave dynasty controlled the sultanate until around 1290 when the Khilji dynasty took over, first by the hand of Jahal-ud-Din Khilji. His family held the throne for less than a century as the Tughlaq dynasty was next to seize power in 1320. The Tughlaq dynasty technically retained power until 1412 but matters were complicated by the incursion led by Timur in 1398 into Delhi. As the Tughlaq dynasty weakened, the Sayyid dynasty replaced them starting in 1414. The Sayyids lasted for roughly 37 years but the last ruler's reign was stained by rebellion and discord as the dynasty fell from grace. Yet another dynastic authority took the open throne, this time being the Lodi dynasty. The new dynasty lasted until the death of the then current ruler Ibrahim Khan Lodi, who was killed in battle at Panipat by the army of Kabul's leader Babur in 1526. Ibrahim's death brought about the final end of the Delhi sultanate as a whole. Now free of competition from the Lodi dynasty, Babur established the Mughal dynasty, which would end up becoming one of the greatest throughout history. The original Turkic-Mongol imperial power ruled a vast majority of India for over two centuries and brought about significant cultural growth and architectural achievements, including the great Taj Mahal. Despite their immense success, the Mughal empire began its decline around the start of the 18th century, as revolt after revolt began to shake the foundations of the widespread power alongside threats from the Marathas and the British. The British East India Company had actually already been in the region for some time, but the situation with the British started to escalate not long after the Mughals fell. By 1857, India displayed increasing control by the East India Company and the locals were having none of it. What began as a simple revolt by Indian soldiers in Meerut quickly blew up into a widespread rebellion and became known as the Indian Mutiny of 1857. This rebellion later would be called the First War of Indian Independence, and even though the British were able to quell the revolt after a matter of months, it inevitably had lasting impacts. In response to the mutiny, on November 1st, 1858, Britain's Queen Victoria declared that India would be ruled in the name of the British Crown from that point on. Locals maintained their disapproval and anger at the British supremacy over their land, and nationalist sentiments and movements were far from extinguished. The next major move towards independence came when Mahatma Gandhi and the Indian National Congress decided to withdraw all cooperation with the British government, beginning the Non-Cooperation Movement following the end of World War I. When this strategy did not bring the wanted results, Gandhi adopted a new technique in the form of the Civil Disobedience Movement in December of 1929. Essentially, the movement was made up of the declaration of an Indian Independence Day that would be celebrated on January 16th, and complete disobedience of any orders by the British government. Again, Gandhi's strategy failed, and this time he was even arrested, while many other rebels were murdered. Still, the British were eventually pushed into the Round Table Conferences beginning in November of 1930, the second of which Gandhi attended. The conferences marked another failure, and civil disobedience reignited. Gandhi's next attempt, the Quit India Movement, again made no drastic progress. World War II brought about new issues as India was forced into war by the British, but at the conflict's conclusion, a new Labour Party came into power in India and showed sympathy towards the fight for independence. And finally, as August 14th turned to 15th in 1947, India became an independent nation."
1,https://youtube.com/watch?v=yqc9zX04DXs,The history of our world in 18 minutes | David Christian,"Translators note First a video Yes, it is a scrambled egg But as you look at it, I hope you'll begin to feel just slightly uneasy Because you may notice that what's actually happening is that the egg is on scrambling itself And you'll now see the yolk and the white are separated and now they're going to be poured back into the egg And we all know in our heart of hearts that this is not the way the universe works a scrambled egg is mush tasty mush But it's mush an egg is a beautiful sophisticated thing that can create even more sophisticated things such as chickens And we know in our heart of hearts that the universe does not travel from mush to complexity in fact This gut instinct is reflected in one of the most fundamental laws of physics the second law of thermodynamics or the law of entropy what that says basically is that the general tendency of the universe is to move from order and structure to lack of order lack of structure in fact to mush and that's why that video feels a bit strange and yet Look around us What we see around us is staggering complexity Eric Beinhocker estimates that in New York City alone. There are some 10 billion skews or distinct commodities being traded That's hundreds of times as many species as there are on earth And they're being traded by a species of almost 7 billion individuals who are linked by trade Travel and the internet into a global system of stupendous complexity So here's a great puzzle In a universe ruled by the second law of thermodynamics How is it possible to generate the sort of complexity? I've described the sort of complexity represented by you and me and the convention center Well the answer seems to be the universe can create complexity, but with great difficulty In pockets there appear what my colleague Fred Spear calls Goldilocks conditions not too hot not too cold just right for the creation of complexity and Slightly more complex things appear and where you have slightly more complex things you can get slightly more complex things and in this way complexity builds stage by stage Each stage is magical because it creates the impression of something utterly new Appearing almost out of nowhere in the universe we refer in big history to these moments as threshold moments and At each threshold the going gets tougher the complex things get more fragile more vulnerable the Goldilocks conditions get more stringent, and it's more difficult to create complexity now we as extremely complex creatures Desperately need to know this story of how the universe creates complexity despite the second law and why complexity means vulnerability and fragility and That's the story that we tell in big history But to do it you have to do something that may at first sight seem completely impossible you have to survey the whole history of the universe So let's do it Let's begin by winding the timeline back 13.7 billion years to the beginning of time Around us there's nothing There's not even time or space imagine the darkest emptiest thing you can and cube it a gazillion times and that's where we are and then suddenly BAM a universe appears an entire universe, and we've crossed our first threshold the universe is tiny. It's smaller than an atom It's incredibly hot it contains everything that's in today's universe so you can imagine It's busting and it's expanding at incredible speed and at first It's just a blur, but very quickly distinct things begin to appear in that blur within the first second energy itself shatters into distinct forces including electromagnetism and gravity and Energy does something else quite magical it congeals to form matter Quarks that will create protons and leptons that include electrons and all of that happens in the first second now we move forward 380 thousand years That's twice as long as humans have been on this planet and now simple atoms appear of hydrogen and helium Now I want to pause for a moment 380,000 years after the origins of the universe because we actually know quite a lot about the universe at this stage We know above all that it was extremely simple It consisted of huge clouds of hydrogen and helium atoms and they have no structure. They're really a sort of cosmic mush But that's not completely true Recent studies by satellites such as the W map satellite have shown that in fact there are just tiny Differences in that background what you see here the blue areas are about a thousandth of a degree Cooler than the red areas. These are tiny differences, but it was enough for the universe to move on to the next stage of building complexity And this is how it works Gravity is more powerful where there's more stuff So where you get slightly denser areas gravity starts compacting clouds of hydrogen and helium atoms So we can imagine the early universe breaking up into a billion clouds and each cloud is compacted Gravity gets more powerful as density increases the temperature begins to rise at the center of each cloud And then at the center of each cloud the temperature crosses the threshold temperature of 10 million degrees protons start to fuse there's a huge release of energy and We have our first stars from about 200 million years after the Big Bang Stars begin to appear all through the universe billions of them and the universe is now significantly more interesting and more complex Stars will create the Goldilocks conditions for crossing two new thresholds When very large stars die they create temperatures so high That protons begin to fuse in all sorts of exotic Combinations to form all the elements of the periodic table if like me you're wearing a gold ring It was forged in a supernova explosion So now the universe is chemically more complex and in the chemically more complex universe It's possible to make more things and what starts happening is that around young sons young stars All these elements combine they swirl around the energy of the star stirs them around they form The particles they form snowflakes they form little dust moats they form rocks They form asteroids and eventually they form planets and moons And that is how our solar system was formed four and a half billion years ago Rocky planets like our earth are significantly more complex than stars because they contain a much greater diversity of materials So we've crossed a fourth threshold of complexity Now The going gets tougher The next stage introduces entities that are significantly more fragile Significantly more vulnerable, but they're also much more creative and much more capable of generating further complexity I'm talking of course about living organisms Living organisms are created by chemistry. We are huge packages of chemicals So chemistry is dominated by the electromagnetic force that operates over smaller scales and gravity which explains Why you and I are smaller than stars or planets? Now, what are the ideal conditions for chemistry? What are the Goldilocks conditions? Well first you need energy But not too much in the center of a star There's so much energy that any atoms that combined will just get busted apart again, but not too little in In intergalactic space, there's so little energy that atoms can't combine What you want is just the right amount and planets it turns out are just right because they're close to stars, but not too close you also need a great diversity of chemical elements and You need liquids such as water. Why? Well in gases Atoms move past each other so fast that they can't hitch up in solids Atoms stuck together. They can't move in liquids They can cruise and cuddle and link up to form molecules Now, where do you find such Goldilocks conditions? Well planets are great and our early earth was almost perfect It was just the right distance from its star to contain huge oceans of liquid water and deep in earth beneath those oceans that cracks In the earth's crust you got heat seeping up from inside the earth and you've got a great diversity of elements so at those deep oceanic vents Fantastic chemistry began to happen and atoms combined in all sorts of exotic combinations but of course Life is more than just exotic chemistry. How do you stabilize those huge molecules that seem to be viable? Well, it's here that life introduces an entirely new trick You don't stabilize the individual you stabilize the template the thing that carries information And you allow the template to copy itself and DNA of course is the beautiful molecule that contains that information You'll be familiar with the double helix of DNA each rung contains information so DNA contains information about how to make living organisms and DNA also copies itself. So it copies itself and scatters the templates through the ocean So the information spreads notice that information has become part of our story The real beauty of DNA though is in its imperfections as it copies itself once in every billion runs There tends to be an error and what that means is that DNA is in fact Learning it's accumulating new ways of making living organisms because some of those errors work So DNA is learning and it's building greater diversity and greater complexity and we can see this happening over the last four billion years For most of that time of life on earth living organisms have been relatively simple single cells But they had great diversity and inside great complexity then from about 600 to 800 million years ago multi-celled organisms appear You get fungi, you get fish, you get plants, you get amphibia, you get reptiles and then of course you get the dinosaurs and Occasionally there are disasters 65 million years ago an asteroid landed on earth near the Yucatan Peninsula Creating conditions equivalent to those of a nuclear war and the dinosaurs are wiped out terrible news for the dinosaurs But great news for our mammalian ancestors who flourished in the niches Left empty by the dinosaurs and we human beings are part of that Creative evolutionary pulse that began 65 million years ago with the landing of an asteroid Humans appeared about 200,000 years ago and I believe we count as a threshold in this great story Let me explain why We've seen that DNA learns in a sense it accumulates information, but it is so slow DNA accumulates information through random errors that just some of which just happen to work But DNA had actually generated a faster way of learning it had produced organisms with brains and those organisms can learn in real time They accumulate information. They learn. The sad thing is when they die the information dies with them Now what makes humans different is human language We are blessed with a language a system of communication so powerful and so precise that we can share what we've learned with such precision that it can accumulate in the collective memory and that means it can outlast the individuals who learnt that information and it can accumulate from Generation to generation and that's why as a species we are so creative and so powerful and that's why we have a history We seem to be the only species in four billion years to have this gift. I call this ability collective learning. It's what makes us different. We can see that work in the earliest stages of human history We evolved as a species in the savannah lands of Africa But then you see humans migrating into new environments into desert lands into jungles into the ice age tundra of Siberia Tough, tough environment into the Americas into Australasia Each migration involved learning, learning new ways of exploiting the environment, new ways of dealing with their surroundings Then 10,000 years ago, exploiting a sudden change in global climates with the end of the last ice age humans learnt to farm. Farming was an energy bonanza and exploiting that energy human populations multiplied human societies got larger, denser, more interconnected and then from about 500 years ago humans began to link up globally through shipping, through trains, through telegraph, through the internet until now we seem to form a single global brain of almost 7 billion individuals and that brain is learning at warp speed and in the last 200 years something else has happened. We've stumbled on another energy bonanza in fossil fuels So fossil fuels and collective learning together explain the staggering complexity we see around us So, here we are, back at the convention center We've been on a journey, a return journey of 13.7 billion years I hope you agree this is a powerful story and it's a story in which humans play an astonishing and creative role but it also contains warnings Collective learning is a very, very powerful force and it's not clear that we humans are in charge of it I remember very vividly as a child growing up in England, living through the Cuban Missile Crisis for a few days the entire biosphere seemed to be on the verge of destruction and the same weapons are still here and they're still armed If we avoid that trap, others are waiting for us We're burning fossil fuels at such a rate that we seem to be undermining the Goldilocks conditions that made it possible for human civilizations to flourish over the last 10,000 years So what big history can do is show us the nature of our complexity and fragility and the dangers that face us but it can also show us our power with collective learning and now finally, this is what I want I want my grandson Daniel and his friends and his generation throughout the world to know the story of big history and to know it so well that they understand both the challenges that face us and the opportunities that face us and that's why a group of us are building a free online syllabus in big history for high school students throughout the world We believe that big history will be a vital intellectual tool for them as Daniel and his generation face the huge challenges and also the huge opportunities ahead of them at this threshold moment in the history of our beautiful planet I thank you for your attention"
2,https://youtube.com/watch?v=-uaMjhpi12M,Title not found,"This is it! This is so cool! History for kids! We are going to learn some fascinating things about the past. And we're going to start off with this. Ancient Rome. Let's start here. Rome is a city that is in Italy. Here is the flag of Italy. The Italian flag. You can see where Rome is on the map of Italy. You can visit Rome today. It's an amazing place. One of the things that make it so amazing is the rich history of the city. See, Rome was formed in the 8th century BC. That was a long time ago. Really, really long time ago. Rome is a very old city. According to legend, Rome was founded by a guy named Romulus in 753 BC. As you might have guessed, Rome got its name from Romulus. That's a cool name. You don't hear that very often. Romulus. Here's the thing though. Many historians believe there were numerous farm communities in the seven hills near Rome and that they joined together to form the city. Wait, that means there may have never been a Romulus. Here is a coin with Romulus and his brother Remus. His brother might be pretend too. Pretend people. Possibly. Possibly. If Romulus was real though, he must have been a really smart guy because the location of Rome was perfect. First, Rome was right along the Tiber River. Now, why would that be important? Well, the Tiber River meant Rome had access to water and water made life and civilization possible. You could see where the Tiber River is and where Rome is on this map. Here is a picture of the Tiber River today. Without the Tiber River, the small city of Rome would have never grown into a massive civilization. Thanks, Tiber River. No, no, really. Thank you, Tiber. Can I call you Tiber? The second reason Rome's location is perfect is that there are huge mountain ranges that protect Rome. The Alps and the Apennines would later make invasions of Rome more difficult. Not only that, Rome is surrounded by hills as well. Rome is protected by natural barriers. In the early days of the city of Rome, Rome was ruled by a king. Sometimes the king would be a jerk and people would be like, well, he's king so we just have to live with this. But in 509 BC, they were sick of it. At that time, they had a king named Tarquin the Proud and you can see him on this coin. Tarquin the Proud. He was an awful king. He killed a lot of people, made everyone miserable and was very arrogant. That's how he got the nickname, the Proud. Tarquin the Proud. I've got to say this though. If this coin is accurate, while he was a terrible king, he did have good hair. That's a pretty cool hairstyle, isn't it? You know. Well, the people kicked him out and they decided to set up a completely different type of government. They made Rome into a republic. You know you did a bad job as king when the place you ruled over just completely changes the government and kicks you out. That's what they did though. They kicked him out. They said, you're out of here. And they said, we are going to start a republic. This is going to be a republic. What a huge change that was. Now, instead of a king making all of the decisions and being in charge, the people would elect people who would serve in the government for a certain amount of time. Instead of following a king's orders, the people were able to do whatever they wanted as long as it didn't break the law. If that sounds like the government of the United States, that's right. The United States is a republic. Many other countries around the world are republics too. Ancient Rome was way ahead of the curve. Rome was one of the first republics in history and under this new form of government, Rome thrived. Rome stayed a republic until 27 AD. Let's fast forward hundreds of years to meet this guy. His name is Julius Caesar. Julius Caesar is one of the most famous people in Roman history. He lived from 100 BC to 44 BC and had a huge impact on ancient Rome. Julius Caesar was a great general and was also an important writer, writing histories of many of the battles he fought in. He was a hero in Rome and was loved by the people. Boy, was Julius Caesar popular. People heard of all of his victories in battle and knew that his soldiers had absolute loyalty to him. It also helped that he wrote about the battles. He did a good job of always making himself sound like the hero. Well, this shouldn't be surprising, but the Senate was afraid of his power and popularity. Julius Caesar was a big deal. Soon, a civil war broke out. Julius Caesar was victorious and returned to Rome as the ruler of the republic. For five years, he was the ruler of the Roman Republic before he was betrayed and killed in Rome. But ancient Rome had changed forever. After Julius Caesar was killed, another civil war broke out. Well, guess what happened next. Julius Caesar's adopted son, Octavian, eventually took over Rome and finally brought peace. He was renamed Augustus and became the first emperor of Rome. Augustus was an effective emperor and ushered in a period called Pax Romana, where the majority of people in the Roman Empire lived their lives without fear of invasion. Pax Romana means Roman peace. After Augustus, Rome was ruled by an emperor named Tiberius, the stepson of Augustus. Wow, all these guys are related. The republic was over and a new period called the Imperial Period began. Wow, ancient Rome went through massive changes through the centuries. Now we are going to talk about the legacy of this fascinating civilization. Like the size of ancient Rome. At its peak, see how huge ancient Rome was. Wow, the Roman Empire is colored purple. That's big. Ancient Rome left a big impact with architecture, with many of their structures still surviving and standing today. Probably the most famous example is the Colosseum. The Colosseum was a massive amphitheater in the city of Rome that still amazes people today. Over 60,000 people could watch sports and events in the Colosseum. Just like the Roman Empire, the Roman Empire was a great empire. Just like us, ancient Romans enjoyed sports and entertainment. In ancient Rome, watching chariot races and fighting were very common. The fighting though would be very violent. Unfortunately, many people lost their lives in the Colosseum. And to us, that type of fighting doesn't even sound like a game. But in ancient Rome, people filled the Colosseum to watch fighters called gladiators fight it out. This is cool. Ancient Rome is also known for having water systems and aqueducts bring fresh water to different places. Ancient Rome also had sewers to dispose of waste. Very important. These advancements helped many people live a better quality of life. Ancient Rome also invented socks. Seriously? Seriously? Next time you wear socks, just think, wow, thank you ancient Rome. These are really cool. How sad would life be if we didn't have socks? And that's from ancient Rome. Even roads. Ancient Rome developed roads that connected the empire. Ancient Romans invented concrete and made stable, reliable roads that made transportation and communication so much easier. Many of the roads in Europe still follow the same path as the ancient Roman roads. Wow, are we coming to the end? No crying. The final impact we want to talk about from ancient Rome is their language. Ancient Romans spoke Latin, a language still used when scientists named plants and animals. And a handful of languages we use today come from Latin. Ancient Rome was one of the most powerful civilizations in all of history, so of course their language would still impact us today. Okay, that was fun. Now we are going to learn about ancient Greece. You see, ancient Greece was a powerful civilization that ruled much of the Mediterranean region. And at times even beyond the Mediterranean region, ancient Greece was so powerful. It is so important to learn about ancient Greece because they impacted us so much. Even though they ruled the Mediterranean several thousand years ago, what is really cool is they impacted so many aspects of our lives. Even sports, math, art, philosophy, the way we do government, the way we do science, that all goes back to the ancient Greeks. Now you might be wondering, where in the world was ancient Greece? Well, we are going to show you on a world map so that you know exactly where in the world we are talking about. Here is the area in the world where ancient Greece was, in a region called the Mediterranean. The Mediterranean is actually the name of a sea, and the area of the sea where ancient Greece was, was called the Mediterranean Basin. Actually, it is still called the Mediterranean Basin. And in fact, ancient Greece, the place where that is, that is where modern day Greece is, and here is the flag of the country of Greece. Now this is kind of cool. Many historians put the story of ancient Greece into three time periods. The first time period is the Archaic Period, the second is the Classical Period, and the third is the Hellenistic Period. These are the three time periods of ancient Greece. Wow, isn't that cool? Archaic Period, Classical Period, and the Hellenistic Period. Okay, so the Archaic Period is the earliest period of ancient Greece, and that is when ancient Greece really started taking its form and its organization. This period ended with the introduction of the government structure called Democracy. Wait, Democracy? What is Democracy? What does that word mean? We said that the Archaic Period ended once Democracy was introduced, but what is Democracy? Well, a Democracy is a government led by the people, either directly or indirectly, through elected officials. It is used all over the world today. In fact, 123 countries in the world use Democracy as their form of government, and it was born in ancient Greece. Democracy was born right here in the city-state called Athens. Different city-states in Greece had different forms of government, but Athens had a Democracy. So then came the Classical Period, the days of ancient Greece that most of us think of. We usually think of the Classical Period. That was when the Greeks first started to build their cities. That was when the city-states of Athens and Sparta were at their strongest. In Athens, the arts and philosophy were so important. In fact, Socrates and Plato were from Athens and lived in Athens. Athens was a place thriving with culture, the arts, and philosophy. Yay! In Sparta, fighting was important. Literally, fighting. They studied war and fighting. They trained the young men when they were boys. Sparta was all about fighting. Sometimes these two city-states would get along and would work together and would even fight together against foreign invaders. But there were so many differences between the two societies. The society in Athens and the society in Sparta. They just had very different interests. So they would fight each other in wars called the Peloponnesian Wars. And just look at this picture. Who do you think won these wars? Yeah, Sparta. But Athens was never completely finished off. Athens was never completely wiped off the map. And so these two city-states just had a unique relationship where sometimes they worked together and sometimes they would fight. We take this brief learning break to show you Mr. Whiskers in honor of Mrs. Camardello's fourth grade class in New York. Because who doesn't like Mr. Whiskers? Right? Who doesn't like Mr. Whiskers? What? You were expecting me to use the special Mr. Whiskers voice? Well, Mr. Whiskers is sleeping, okay? I'm not going to just talk that way for you. But if he was awake, you know... The classical period of ancient Greece ended with the death of the most famous leader of ancient Greece, whose name was Alexander the Great. He spent much of his childhood in Athens and was trained by the famous philosopher Aristotle. After uniting most of Greece, he stretched the Greek Empire all the way to India to the east and Egypt to the west. Want to know something cool? He never lost one battle. Never lost one battle! Wow! Even though Alexander the Great was a Macedonian prince, he did grow up in Greece and he loved Greek culture and spread the Greek culture around the ancient world. When Alexander the Great died, it started a period of ancient Greece called the Hellenistic period, the final period of ancient Greece. This final period of ancient Greece ended in 146 BC when Rome conquered Greece and made Greece a Roman province. Even if you don't realize it, day by day, things that we do were impacted by ancient Greece. The way we do math and literature, when we study science and philosophy, our forms of government, that's all impacted by this ancient civilization from the Mediterranean. Cool! Now we are going to learn about an important figure in American history. It's this guy. His name was George Washington. George Washington was a military general and led the American colonists to victory in the American Revolution. He was a founding father of the United States, meaning he was one of the people who started the United States of America. And he served as the first president of the United States, the very first president of the United States. Let's look at his life to see how George Washington helped start the United States of America. It starts in 1732. Wow, that was a long time ago. George Washington was born in the colony of Virginia in 1732. Now, when George Washington was born, the colony of Virginia was part of Great Britain. In fact, all of the American colonies were part of Great Britain. This is what the British flag looked like during George Washington's lifetime. It looked pretty similar to what it looks like today. The colony of Virginia, the place where George Washington grew up, belonged to Great Britain. Now, a lot of people have wondered what George Washington was like as a kid, right? But George Washington didn't share many details about his childhood. There is a popular legend about George Washington when he was six years old. George Washington was a very smart boy. He was a very smart boy. He was six years old. It's an interesting one. The legend says that George Washington received an axe for his birthday and used it on one of his dad's cherry trees. Oh, that's a weird gift to get for your sixth birthday. When his dad found out that his cherry tree was damaged by young George, George was brave and told his dad the truth, saying, I cannot tell a lie. This legend is one of the most famous legends in American history. The legend was written by this guy, a man named Parson Weems. That's an interesting name. He was the first person to write a biography on George Washington after he died. Most historians believe this story was made up by Parson Weems. Even though it was made up, it is a legend that many people think of when they think of George Washington. One thing we know for sure about George's childhood is that his dad died when George was just 11 years old. After his dad died, George spent some time living with his half-brother named Lawrence at a place called Mount Vernon, the plantation owned by Lawrence. Living with his half-brother Lawrence, George was able to learn how to survey land. To survey land is to figure out the distance between different parts of a piece of land, usually to figure out how big a piece of land is. Someone who surveys land is called a land surveyor. In order to be a land surveyor, you have to know a lot of math. George Washington had to use his math skills to survey land. As he got older, people paid him to survey their land, and he had to use math skills every time he did it. This is pretty cool. Here is a picture of a land survey done by George Washington himself. Oh my goodness, he had fancy handwriting. This is so sad. He may have continued working as a surveyor if it weren't for another tragedy in his life. Nine years after his dad died, George's half-brother Lawrence got sick and died too. George was 20 years old when Lawrence died. Two years later, when George was just 22 years old, he became the full owner of Mount Vernon. We didn't mention this earlier, but Lawrence had been a military general for the British in the Virginia Militia. Remember, the colony of Virginia, like the other American colonies, belonged to Great Britain. George decided to follow in his footsteps and became a major in the Virginia Militia. This was a big deal, especially for someone as young as George was. And it didn't take long for George Washington to be put to the test. The governor of Virginia sent George Washington to the United States to study the history of the British. He sent George Washington on a special mission to tell the French to leave an area called the Ohio Valley. They didn't like that, and they made it clear they would not leave the Ohio Valley. And one year later, George Washington led hundreds of soldiers in an event that would start the French and Indian War. The French and Indian War made George Washington famous. He wrote about his experiences and became well known, not just in the colonies, but also across the Atlantic Ocean in Great Britain. The French and Indian War not only made George Washington famous, but it also gave him military experience that he would later need during the American Revolution. After the war, George was not offered a placement in the regular British Army, which must have been so frustrating after all he did. And he returned to his plantation, remember, called Mount Vernon. He got married to a lady named Martha and started a family at Mount Vernon. So he settled down, and that might have been the end of his story, but he also got involved in politics, which would put him at the right place at the right time. After years of being a politician in Virginia, in 1774, George Washington was chosen to be a delegate of Virginia in the First Continental Congress. A delegate is someone who is sent to represent other people. Virginia trusted George Washington to represent their interests. It was really cool. George Washington was frustrated with how the colonies were being treated by Great Britain, just like so many other colonists. Many of their rights were taken away by laws called the Intolerable Acts. Colonists called them the Intolerable Acts because they weren't able to take it. They were intolerable. Well, in 1775, the American Revolutionary War began, and the Second Continental Congress decided to set up their own army, called the Continental Army. They selected George Washington as the commander of the Continental Army. It made sense. He not only had a lot of experience as a general in the French and Indian War, but he also wanted the American colonies to be independent and free from Great Britain. George Washington accepted the position, but he refused to get paid to serve as commander of the Continental Army. That's right. He wanted to volunteer and serve without any cost to the American colonies. What a nice guy. So he got to work. George Washington trained and prepared the Continental Army for battle. He wanted to make sure they were ready and helped them become a better, stronger army. And here was his job, if you will. George Washington helped come up with battle plans, led the Continental Army in many battles, and helped the Continental Army run like a well-organized unit. And he was a great commander. Part of what made him a great commander was he was not afraid to take risks. For example, in one of the most famous moments in the Revolutionary War, George Washington led troops across the Delaware River to do a surprise attack on December 25th in 1776. That was Christmas night. Oh my goodness. Even though the water was icy and dangerous, George Washington knew it would be a great day to do it. Everyone was like, George, too much ice, too much ice, man. But they pressed on and it was a big victory for the Continental Army. George Washington eventually led the Continental Army to victory. With help from the French, the Americans defeated the British. After the war, George Washington was able to build a new army. After winning the Revolutionary War, the American colonies began setting up their brand new government. And really to no one's surprise, George Washington was picked to lead the Constitutional Convention that established order in the new government. And of course, because he was presiding over everything, George Washington signed the Constitution. Then, when it came time to elect officials, the American people decided there was no better man to serve as the very first president of the United States than George Washington himself. He was elected president in the first national election. In 1789, after he was sworn in as president of the United States, he went to live in Philadelphia. Philadelphia was the temporary capital of the United States. This is a picture of the house he lived in while he was president. Now, of course, this was before the White House was built. This is the house in Philadelphia that George Washington lived in. Before we keep talking about George Washington as president, we have a random fun fact about George Washington for you. Did you know that George Washington didn't wear a wig? That's right, that was always his own hair. He grew it long and would just pull it back. The reason his hair always looked white was because he powdered his hair. He must have thought it looked awesome. So if anyone ever asks you for a cool random fact, let them know that George Washington didn't wear a wig. Guess he didn't need one. It's shocking, isn't it, Mr. Whiskers? It's just crazy. He didn't wear a wig. He didn't wear a wig. All right. Well, back to George Washington as president. As we mentioned earlier, he was living in Philadelphia, which was the temporary capital of the United States, which is interesting. And as you might imagine, as neat as being the first president sounds, it was really difficult and challenging. There were many issues that needed fixing, you know, being a brand new nation and all. But George Washington worked hard to give the United States a strong start. In the second national election, George Washington was elected president for the second time. He refused to run a third time and started the tradition by most presidents of serving no more than two terms. Can you spot President George Washington in this picture? Yeah, he's right there, right there. Yep. Not only did George Washington help the American colonies win their independence and become a new nation, but George Washington also served as the first president of the United States. That is why George Washington is often called the father of his country. Sadly, George Washington wasn't able to see much of what America would become. He became sick and died in 1799 at Mount Vernon. George Washington made a huge impact and he is celebrated and honored all around us. The capital of the United States, Washington, D.C., was named after George Washington. The Washington Monument in Washington, D.C., was built to honor the memory of George Washington, the father of the United States. We see George Washington honored on our money like the dollar bill. Dollar bills are super cool and George Washington is on all of them. He is also on the quarter. George Washington is on the front of every single quarter, even the state quarters. And of course, George Washington is on Mount Rushmore. It's the amazing sculpture that was carved right into the granite of a mountain in South Dakota. Wow. He is featured on many other sculptures, but this is the biggest and most famous. What a life George Washington lived. Here are just a couple of his accomplishments. He was a general in the French and Indian War. He was the commander of the Continental Army and he was the first president of the United States. Next, we are going to learn about another important figure in history named Abraham Lincoln. He is famous for his beard. Back then, a lot of people called beards whiskers, almost like a cat. Look, Mr. Whiskers, you have something in common with Abraham Lincoln. As fun as his beard was, he isn't just famous for what he looked like. He is famous for what he did. He served as president during some of the most challenging years in American history, saving our union when we were in the midst of war and abolishing slavery. Let's look closely at the life of Abraham Lincoln starting from when he was a baby. It was a long time ago. Abraham Lincoln was born way back in 1809. This is a replica of the house where Abraham Lincoln was born. A replica is an exact copy of something. This is a replica of his beard. This is a replica of his birthplace so we can have an idea of the small, humble beginnings of this future leader. It was a one-room log cabin in Kentucky. When Abraham Lincoln was seven years old, his family moved to Indiana. His dad was a hard worker, farming and working with wood as a carpenter. His parents taught their children about living in the country. These parents taught their children about living a moral life and were very religious. They taught their children what was right and wrong on many issues, including slavery. Abraham Lincoln was taught how wrong slavery was, a belief he held throughout his life. Slavery was a terrible system that treated people like property. A slave had no rights and was forced to do whatever their owner told them to. Slavery is wrong and it was wrong back then. There were many people who wanted to end it because they knew that every person should have rights. Now, as a young man, Abraham Lincoln was passionate about reading and writing. Here is a statue of young Abraham Lincoln found in Chicago. His neighbors used to think he was lazy because he preferred sitting down and enjoying books instead of going outside to do hard labor. He taught himself most things. While he would occasionally have teachers, it was never for very long. He loved reading and learning and wasn't afraid to teach himself. Later, when Abraham Lincoln was 22 years old, he struck out on his own, and moved to Salem in Illinois. It was from there that he once took goods by boat to New Orleans, where he saw slavery firsthand. He remembered what his parents taught him about slavery. No one could have guessed that he would be the person to abolish it. When he returned, he got busy. At the age of 23, he bought and ran a general store for a while, then shortly after, served as a captain during the Black Hawk War, and ran for political office for the very first time, losing an election. After losing the election, he became a lawyer, studying law all on his own. Remember, he loved learning and reading. Even though he lost his first election, he didn't want to give up. He ran again for office, but this time he won and served four terms in the Illinois House of Representatives. He was only 25 years old. It was during this time serving in the Illinois House of Representatives that he met Mary Todd, and they married in 1842, when Abraham Lincoln was 33 years old. They went on to have four children together. They moved to Springfield, Illinois, where they bought this home. It would be their home for 17 years. It was the only house that Abraham Lincoln ever owned. And here's the cool thing. The cool thing is that you can visit Abraham Lincoln's house in Springfield, Illinois today. You can visit his original house. Wow, that hair though. Woo, somebody get him a comb. After serving in the Illinois House of Representatives, he wanted to serve not just Illinois, but the entire United States. So he ran for the United States House of Representatives, but lost. But he was later able to serve a two-year term. He wasn't done. He ran for the U.S. Senate against Stephen Douglas. His debates with Stephen Douglas are considered the best political debates in American history. While Abraham Lincoln did not win the election, the campaign against Douglas made Abraham Lincoln famous and set the stage for his campaign for the presidency of the United States. Notice, Abraham Lincoln didn't quit, even after losing so many elections. He is a great example of not giving up. Abraham Lincoln finally ran for president, and he won. In 1861, he became the 16th president of the United States. Look, he has the beard. When Abraham Lincoln became president, the United States was divided over many issues, especially slavery. This is sad. Once Abraham Lincoln was elected, the South began the process of splitting away from the United States, which started what became known as the Civil War. The South set up their own country, named the Confederate States of America. While there were many disagreements they had with Abraham Lincoln, they knew that Abraham Lincoln was against slavery. Abraham Lincoln had always been against slavery. He knew it was wrong. This was a major reason in the South for leaving the United States. Abraham Lincoln led the Union through these difficult days. The Civil War began in 1861 and went on for four years. Two years into the war, Abraham Lincoln signed something called the Emancipation Proclamation, which was an executive order that declared all of the slaves free. The powerful words said that all slaves were to be free forever. Here's the thing. Abraham Lincoln never forgot the lessons he learned as a young man. All people are valuable and should be treated with equality and respect. The boy born in Kentucky, who lived in Indiana and then moved to Illinois, just changed American history by abolishing slavery. That same year at Gettysburg, a place where an important battle in the Civil War took place, Abraham Lincoln made one of the most famous speeches in American history, later called the Gettysburg Address. This picture was taken during the Gettysburg Address. Right here is Abraham Lincoln. He opened the speech with these words, Four score and seven years ago, our fathers brought forth on this continent a new nation, conceived in liberty and dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal. Two years later, the Union won the Civil War, but the joy was short lived. A man named John Wilkes Booth, angry that the Confederate States of America lost the war, plans to kill Abraham Lincoln. Just days after the Civil War ended, John Wilkes Booth shot Abraham Lincoln in Ford's Theater. He died shortly after, leaving this country broken hearted. Abraham Lincoln changed American history and his legacy lives on today. There is a massive memorial that honors his memory called the Lincoln Memorial in Washington, D.C. His face is featured on Mount Rushmore with other legendary presidents. And of course his face is on the five dollar bill and on the penny. He is all over the place and for good reason. Abraham Lincoln held America together during the most challenging days in American history, when our country was literally at war with each other. He abolished slavery, freeing millions of people and was killed for standing up for what he believed in. History is fascinating and fun. Be sure and comment below.

This is the proverb of Hindi which you must have read and heard many times. And this is absolutely true and necessary. If you have decided in your mind that you want to achieve this, then you will see that your efforts will be at the same level. It is a definite thing that you are going to achieve that. But if you have decided in your mind that this is wrong, this cannot happen, we will not be able to achieve it. Then you will see that your efforts will not be at the same level. Welcome back to our amazing platform, BW. I am your friend, your mentor Kunal this side. So kids, today we have another great chapter, that is, Age of Industrialization. We will cover this in a very short time. So let's start our chapter quickly. Let's get started, that is, the Age of Industrialization. Kids, we will do a quick and interesting revision. We will quickly see its pointers. So what are you going to study today? Today we are going to talk about Proto-Industrialization, Industrial Change, Peculiarities and Market for Goods. Let's start, kids. If you can see two pictures here, what does it show? It is simple, if you see the first picture, so many machineries have been shown in it. And in the second picture, the magicians shown are Aladdin and a modern engineer. One engineer is creating so many things with the magic of his science. And our second brother, Aladdin, is building a palace with the magic of his magic, the magic of his genius. It means that the people of the old days, especially the western people, considered the eastern people to be very old. They called us the Orient. The Orient means a land where everything is suspicious, people do magic, and at the same time they have something that the world does not know. So this is how we were understood. Then if we talk about a time when industrialization was possible even before industrialization. It means a time when industrialization was possible even before big factories and where goods were sold in the international market. But the way of producing goods was very different. So basically it is a phase that exists before our industrialization or before such a time when factories came to England and Europe. Kids, at a very high level, you can say that industrial production used to be there to sell in the international market. But this production was not in any factory or any big industry. It used to happen in people's homes, in people's villages, especially if I talk about the countryside, village sides. If we talk about the 17th and 18th centuries, the merchants, it is a very simple thing, your traders used to go to the villages from Europe. The weavers in the villages used to supply raw materials and money. And in return, they used to tell them that to sell in the international market, design a product for us of good quality. They used to buy that product and sell it in the market. So you can say that kids, it is a very simple thing here, when farmers are poor peasants, they used to accept this offer easily. Because the best part they had was that they could do agriculture by staying in their village. Plus, additionally, they can earn more money by doing this work. Also, if you are asked this question that why do not merchants, traders who come to your village, do this work in the cities? See, what was in the cities was that there were particular trade organizations that you also call guilds. So what is a guild? Suppose I sell rice. So there are 10 more people with me who sell rice. So we together made an organization that we will sell rice in 10 markets, the 11th person will not come here. We secured monopoly. So there were many such guilds in the international markets. Along with that, if we talk about merchants, if we talk about the towns, which did not allow the merchants outside to come here. Because they had made a monopoly on trade with the help of local rulers. So what did such people do? They used to go to our winter villages, countries and there they used to go and give orders. Now if you talk about children, that in this whole system, a close relationship developed between the countryside as well as the towns. So these merchants were very simple, they used to get someone to do some work. Like if we talk about a cloth merchant, then what will the cloth merchant do? He will buy wool from a stapler, he will buy wool, after that he will give it to the spinner so that he can weave it in thread. Then the thread will go to the weaver, the weaver will make the fabric. Then the child will take this fabric to the dyer, who will color it. After coloring it, it will be sent to London. So London became a finishing market in a way where the final product was given shape and size. So such things are very common. You may be asked about the stapler and the fuller. So children, what is a stapler and fuller? A stapler is the person who sorts the wool according to his quality. A fuller is the person who collects and stores the cloth. And if we talk about carding, then carding is the process in which the children prepare the wool or cotton before spinning or weaving. So all these three can be included in your one markers. That is why they are important. Let's talk further about the saving. In 1730, the earliest factories are seen in England. But if we talk about their number, it started increasing in the later 18th century. Then if I talk about cotton, which is the first symbol of the new era, its production increased a lot in the 19th century. Then if we talk about Richard Ackroyd, he is the person who created the first cotton mill. Cotton mill means all the machinery and management came under one unit. Now you don't have to go separately for your production process. If we talk about 1760, Britain was importing 2.5 million pounds of cotton to feed its cotton industry. And by 1787, 22 million pounds of cotton was imported. So you can say that cotton was a leading sector in the first half of the 18th century. It brought a lot of importance to the industry. Then if we see the industrial changes, cotton replaced iron and steel industry. There were many factors. We will study each one of them one by one. Let's talk about factor number one. The most dynamic industries in Britain were cotton and metals with respect to iron and steel. If we talk about cotton, which was a leading sector in the rapid pace till 1840, after that, the iron and steel industry boomed a lot. The reason for that is the expansion of railways. When railways started expanding, railways needed more rail tracks. To make rail tracks, you needed iron and steel. If we talk about England, the railway expansion started in 1840. And the area where England was occupied, the railway boomed in the 1860s. So by 1873, Britain was exporting iron and steel worth 77 million pounds. So you can say that iron and steel was a very dynamic sector after the cotton industry. Secondly, it is important to note that our new industries did not easily displace the old industries. If you see, at the end of the 19th century, only 20% of the population was working in factories. The rest of the population is still working in small cottage industries. The reason for this is very simple. There were many people who personally believed in handcrafted materials. They felt that what is made in factories and machinery is made for the public. It is not common for us. So that is why many people preferred hand-made products. So you can say that the traditional industries survived because you will keep getting small technical changes. So if we talk about small innovations, you will see non-mechanical changes in traditional and old industries. Like food processing, glass work, tanning industry. So all these kids are very good examples of industrial change. Then if we talk about the story of the steam engine. James Ward was a man who improved the steam engine produced by Newcomen. After that, he got it patented in 1781. He has an industrialist friend, Matthew Bolton, who made a new model of it. But if we talk about steam engines, many industries were not being used at that time. If you see this flow chart, then at the beginning of the 19th century, only 321 steam engines were being used in the whole of England. Out of which, 80 were in the cotton industry, 9 in the wool industry, and the rest were being used in mining, canal and ironworks. So you can see that the steam engines came, but it did not happen that the mechanical industries in Europe boomed and the traditional industries went bad. The fourth reason is that the technological changes came very slowly. But the problem is that the new technology is comparatively expensive. If it breaks, it is also very expensive to repair it. So many of our investors and industrialists were not interested in buying the new technology. Then if we talk about hand labor and power stream. If we talk about many industries, the demand for labor was very seasonal in nature. If we talk about the brewery industry, gasworks, then when Christmas came, the book industry, book binding industry, it was booming. Because people give gifts on Christmas. Like people used to gift books on Christmas. Especially when the cold was increasing, people had a requirement for liquor. The brewery industry was increasing, gasworks were increasing. So all this is seasonal demand. If you hire a machine, then heavy investment will be made in the machine. But labor is a comparatively cheaper investment. What will you do with labor? You will hire more labor according to the season. When the season is not there, you will fire the labor. So you can save your money there. Especially if we talk about the ship repairing industry. So these are such industries that when the ship is being repaired in winter, the ship is being rebuilt, then labor is required. But when the season is not there, then labor is not required. So if these people buy machines, then the machines are at a loss. That's why they resorted to the cheap available labor. Now if you see, in the 17th and 18th century Britain, the upper class people generally preferred handmade goods. Because they felt that handmade goods were made only for them and were much better than the common people. Isn't it children? That's why they felt that the machine-made goods were good to sell in the colony. But for us, handmade goods are perfect and justified. That is why these guys did not prefer machine-made goods. Then if we talk about the countries where the labor shortage was there, the industrialists there were okay to use machines. But if we talk about the United States, there was no shortage of labor in Britain. Because the population in Britain was so high that the children were easily available there. Now if we talk about the life of workers, the workers' lives were greatly affected by labor. The problem was that there were fewer jobs in the market, but there were a lot of people who were asking for jobs. So the number of factors, the problem is very simple here. The people who need jobs are a lot and jobs are less available. So getting jobs in factories depended on whether your friend or relative works there. If a friend or relative works, you will get a job and you will keep wandering. And those who did not get a job, they became unemployed and kept wandering on the streets. Some slept in the bridge, some slept on the footpath, some slept in night refugee camps. So now we can say that it was very difficult for workers to get a job until the mid-19th century. If we talk about the early 19th century, the wages increased a little, but there was no special benefit. Let's see why. Now what happened was that the fear of unemployment made people hostile in respect of new technology. People thought that if technology comes, their jobs will go, which is very problematic. After 1840, the building activity intensified. Infrastructure started to boost, roads started to be built, tunnels started to dig, railways expanded, drainage started to be built. So all these reasons are very important with respect to the lives of the workers. As a result, the employment opportunities started to increase. So as a result, we see that our employment opportunities increased. So our workers found some new kind of freedom. Now let's talk about the spinning journey. Spinning journey is a very good example. So what happened in the weaving industry, as you can see, there are many spindles here. So what happened was that James R. Greaves designed this machine in 1764. There was nothing to do in this. A labourer would come and rotate this wheel. And with one rotation, all the spindles would start working. And you can see very easily that threads would start to get entangled. So this was very easy for the weaving industry. Earlier, the spinning process was very slow. But with the advent of the spinning journey, this could have increased. Now, if we talk about India, the silk and cotton goods of India dominated the international market. But there were many Indian merchants who were involved in this game. We know them as supply merchants. There were many Indian merchants involved in this entire network. But if you look at it slowly, this network was breaking down till 1750. What used to happen was that the Indian supply merchants used to go to villages and give money to the weavers. They used to supply raw materials and buy goods from them. After buying goods, they used to come to the ship port from where the goods are exported. Now, the big industrialists here had brokers. The brokers used to negotiate with the supply merchants, buy clothes and sell them. So this entire system used to run. But what happened was that from 1750, the battle of Plassey took place. After 1757, the Britishers started to expand their territory in our country. You can say that the Britishers started to monopolize the major areas. As a result, we see that the Indian control over the trade has started to end. Who is controlling now? European companies are controlling now. How did they do this? Britain was aware of this. The problem with the British was that they had to pay huge taxes. Why? Because if you look at the Bengal and Karnataka regions, their competition is with the French, Portuguese and local rulers. So first of all, they couldn't get raw materials. Secondly, they had to pay high taxes. So what did they do? They started taking concessions from the local kings. And secondly, when they defeated the kings and took over the areas, they established a monopoly over trade. So if we talk about the past, the Masooli Patnam was one of the important ports. But when the power came to the Britishers, they declined. And you will see that the ports of Bombay and Calcutta started to grow. European companies were controlling the trade. And the goods that were exported in Indian ships, are now being exported in European ships. So there were many old trading houses that collapsed. However, those who wanted to survive, had to work in European companies and survive. Only then was it possible. Otherwise, they will not survive. After 1760, the East India Company established its power in India. So the first thing that happened was that the finished products that were exported to India, to be sold in the international market, the finished textile started declining. Because the producers had to face competition. So they were saying, bring raw cotton, but sell our goods in the Indian market. Then if we talk about the political power, when the East India Company established in Bengal and Karnataka, before that, they were having a very difficult time getting supplies and goods. That is what we discussed. But when they established political power, they eliminated competition, controlled the price, and ensured that whoever deals with them, will deal with them and not with anyone else. Now let's talk about the measures taken by the children. First, the traders and brokers, who are related to the trade of clothes, first eliminate them. To eliminate them, it is necessary to create direct control over the weavers. Now what did they do in this? They hired some agents, which is called Gomast. Gomast's job was to go to the weavers, give them advance payment and take supplies from them. Check the quality of the supply and then go and sell it to the British. But the problem was that the companies that were dealing with the weavers, that is, the British East India Company, were in a contract that they cannot deal with anyone else. They cannot sell their clothes to anyone else. So they were given a loan to buy raw materials. Once the order was placed, the weavers had to make clothes for the people who took the loan. And to collect all this work, they hired an agent, which we call Gomast. So the poor weavers did not have enough time to work with their families. The whole family is involved in weaving. Earlier, there were so many buyers, the price was competitive, so the weaver could compete for the price. But now the competition for a good price has ended. Because the people who took loans from the British East India Company, the weavers who took loans from the British East India Company, the children were bound to produce only for the East India Company. They could not deal with anyone else. And the problem is that the children who were hired by Gomast, were outsiders who had no link with the villagers. In 1772, Henry Petulio said that the demand for Indian textile can never fall because the quality of the cloth produced in India is incomparable in the whole world. But if we talk about the 19th century, India's textile exports declined. I have told you the reason for this. The British manufacturing industry, the British mills were pressurizing the Indian colonial government to send raw cotton from India, but not the fabric, because our trade is being impacted by this. So if you look at 1811-1812, the fabric accounted for 33% of India's exports, but by 1850, it fell to only 3%. So you see, the British mills' goods have stopped the Indian markets. So you see, the cotton industry was growing in England, so it was again a great sign of stress for them. What happened was that they pressurized the government to increase the import duties. And the simple thing is that the goods from Manchester, the cloths that are being made in Manchester, were sold in the Indian markets, especially in the Indian markets. And if we talk about the British cotton goods, the exports of British cotton goods increased in India, and the cloths exported from India declined. But this does not mean that India did not send cotton. India is sending cotton, but in raw form. Now, India is sending raw cotton to feed the industries. So if we talk about the Indian cotton goods by 1850, it is a very simple thing. Indian cotton goods have been reduced here, and the British cotton goods have been imported to India. Now, if we talk about... So at the end of the 18th century, the import of cotton goods was restricted into India. The cotton weavers in India had two problems. First, the export of goods. First, they used to export the cloths from India. They used to get a good price. But now, that is also not possible. So the export market collapsed. Second, the imported goods from Manchester are comparatively cheaper in the Indian market, and no one is buying their goods. Then if we talk about 1860, the weavers had another problem. They were not getting a sufficient amount of good quality cotton. Because all the raw cotton was being sent to Britain. So when the American Civil War happened, the cotton supply was stopped from the US, so Britain completely turned towards India for the supply of our raw cotton. So the raw cotton exports increased from India. If you see, as a result, when the demand will increase, and the supply will not be maintained, the price of the product will increase. And here also, the price of the raw cotton was increasing. So if you see, till the 19th century, our other craftsmen were also facing a big problem because of this kind of shortage. Okay? Let's go. So if we talk about the new factories, in 1854, your first cotton mill was set up in Bombay. In 1862, four more mills were set up. Then if we talk about the jute mills, which were set up in Bengal around 1862. The first one was set up in Rishra. The first jute mill was set up back in 1855. Another one was set up seven years later in 1862. In 1860, if we talk about North India, the Elgin mill was set up in Kanpur. One year later, the first cotton mill was set up in Ahmedabad. In 1874, the first spinning and weaving mill was set up in Madras. So, kids, all these are important for your one markers. These are factual questions, so you should remember when and where the years started. Okay? Then if we talk about the early entrepreneurs, who were the ones who financed India? So, kids, there were many traders in India, many businessmen who financed many Indian activities. Okay? Basically, these were the people who earned their income especially from the China trade. What did Britain do? They grew opium in India. Opium is what they call it. It was sold in China and tea was bought from China. So, there were many businessmen who were involved in the China trade and they made a lot of profits. Like, Dwarkan and Tagore were a very good example who made a lot of money from the China trade. In Bombay, there were Parsi's like Dineshwar Pateet, Jamshedji, Nuswantji, Tata. So, they set up big industrial empires in India. Sethukumshendu, a Marwari businessman, he set up the first Indian jute mill in 1917. So, kids, if we talk about these people, they were the ones who made a lot of money from the British trade and they financed the Indian traders in a good way. Then if we talk about the kids, because of the colonial power, their entry into the international market was barred. So, they had to deal in the international market. So, European managing agencies, like there are three big agencies here, Bird Heiler, Andrew Yule, Jadin Skinner. So, kids, there are three major agencies through which if you want to deal with our businessmen in the international market, you have to go through them. So, these people attacked the colonial control and said that this is absolutely wrong. Okay, now let's talk about the workers. Where do the kids come from? If the factories were expanding, then you will see that workers will also be needed. About 50% of the workers of the Bombay cotton industry used to come from Ratnagiri district of Maharashtra. If I talk about Kanpur, then the neighboring areas of Kanpur, the nearby villages, the maximum labor used to come from there. Okay, so as the news of employment increased, the workers started migrating to these cities in large numbers. As a result, if you see, the demand for workers increased, but still the workers had to get a job, which was a very big task. In such cases, the industrialists used to give a task to an old worker. His name was Jobber. You can ask a question in one mark that who was the Jobber? Jobber is an old trusted worker whose job is to bring new workers from his village, settle them in the city, help them out. Now over the period of time, Jobber's profile became so important that he started demanding gifts. You can say that our Jobber was a little corrupt. Okay, then if we talk about the European managing agencies, you can say that they were interested in certain products, like tea and coffee. Okay, so they established tea and coffee plantations, mining plantations. Okay, so these products were those products like Indigo, tea, coffee, mines, minerals, which were exclusively used in the export market. Okay, in the late 19th century, the Indian businessmen started setting up their industries. Okay, like if we talk about the yarn mills in India, they were producing good quality of yarn. Now, there were many such things, which were being exported in China. So you can see that the Indian industrial growth is very fragmented. First of all, it has colonial control because the European managing agencies are majorly focusing on the crop whose exposure in the market is very good. Okay, after that if we talk about the yarn which is being produced in India's spinning mills, it is being used in India or it is being exported in China. Okay, so we get to see many such important things. Then if we talk about the process of industrialization, it was affected by many movements. For example, the Swadeshi boycott. What happened because of the Swadeshi boycott? The production of foreign goods was down because people boycotted it. And the production of Swadeshi handmade goods was stopped somewhere. If you see till 1906, the Indian yarn which was being exported in China, its production has declined now. Why? Because the Japanese mills had flooded the market. If we talk about the end of the World War I, the industrial growth was very slow. Okay, then if we talk about the war, it completely changed the market. Because what happens is that the maximum British mills or British countries were so invested in making war products that they were not able to make other things. So ultimately, the opportunity comes to the Indian mills who along with the war equipment started making the common usage equipment. Okay, so you can say that after the war, there were many industrial equipment requirements and during the war, the requirement of industrial equipment boomed. But the problem is that after the war, Manchester was never able to recapture its lost position in the Indian market. Then if I talk about the small scale industries, then even now, the small scale industries were dominating the industrial phase. For example, if we see, the small scale industries, they predominated the rest of the country. There was a small proportion of the total industrial force which was working in the big factories. But the rest of the people were working in the small workshops in the household units. Okay, then if we talk about the 20th century, the handloom cloth production expanded a lot. This happened because the small technological changes helped in expanding the production without increasing the cost of production. So the cost of production did not increase much but the total production helped out, increased, expanded. Why did it expand? With the help of little small improvements. If we talk about the middle of the 20th century, there were many weavers who used fly shuttles to make simple mechanical devices which increased the production comparatively. Some groups of weavers were in a good position but not everyone was in a good position. Some weavers produced thick cloth and some produced fine cloth. So you can say that, the production expanded but that does not mean that they became rich or became very rich. They worked for many hours, they worked for many long hours. If we talk about it, we can see that their life, their labour is very important with respect to industrialization. But before, if we talk about the time of proto-industrialization, the weavers had time for themselves but with the increased pace of industrialization, they did not have time for themselves. Although their whole family was invested in working here. Gradually, if the kids move forward, the world comes to advertisement. When new products are introduced, it is very important to advertise and market them so that people can help in shaping their minds with respect to their products. If we talk about the street walls, painting, multimedia ads, social media ads that you see today, such ads were used in those days. For example, if we talk about the label of Manchester and the goods were sold so that it is understood that the quality of goods is of the highest quality, the best quality. The goods were sold by putting images of Hindu gods and goddesses. Calendars were sold. Calendars were simple things, simple decorative items. It would look very beautiful on a poor man's wall. So there was advertisement and the issue of calendar date was also solved. We get many such examples. Printing calendars, images of Hindu gods and goddesses, were put on many products so that people can be sure that the product is of very good quality. So many products were marketed and popularized. I have two good examples behind me. Like Krishna's photo is on a product of a small child. To certify that this is an absolutely good product. So this was our topic. It was a long topic and a quick recall for you. So my recommendation is that please read NCRT again. So overall, there were two to three facets. What were the technological changes, what was the impact of the proto-industrialization on India and how did it control the Indian industries? So the entire chapter revolves around this. You have to practice NCRT questions and back questions. The MIP series is going on. I will definitely ask questions in that. You have to additionally do it. I will meet you in the next episode with a quick wrap-up. Until then, I will meet you. Bye-bye everyone. Take care and have a nice and amazing day. Bye everyone."
